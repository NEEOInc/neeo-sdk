## Prerequisite

* You must have at least Node.js v6 installed, see http://nodejs.org

### Windows OS

* If you use the SDK on Windows we suggest to install Apple iTunes (or the Bonjour SDK for Windows, available from the https://developer.apple.com site). Windows versions < 10 seems to miss multicast DNS support (aka. Bonjour/Zeroconf). This means the Brain discovery find's a NEEO Brain but you cannot connect to the NEEO Brain (as the discovery fails). You can test if multicast DNS works on your machine when you try to `ping NEEO-xxxxxxxx.local` (replace xxxxxxxx with the unique hostname of your NEEO Brain).

## NEEO-CLI

The NEEO-CLI now lives in a dedicated repository: [@neeo/cli](https://github.com/NEEOInc/neeo-sdk-toolkit/tree/master/cli)

The neeo-sdk cli is deprecated and will be removed in a future version to make the neeo-sdk smaller. We recommend switching to the new CLI as soon as possible.

### Why the NEEO-CLI?

One goal of the CLI is to make it easy and simple to run SDK devices without writing any code for non developers.
A NEEO-SDK user should be able to run multiple drivers easily without writing code (unlike development that focuses on a single driver at a time). That's where the CLI comes in:

```
# Example setup:
sdk-drivers/
  node_modules/
    # NEEO SDK drivers installed via npm:
    neeo-driver-lifx/
    neeo-driver-ps4/
    neeo-driver-coffee/
    # ... other modules as well
  package.json
```

Running `neeo-cli start` will find and load all 3 drivers (lifx, ps4, coffee). This means you don't have to worry about the folders, the ports or changing any code.

### _deprecated_ NEEO-sdk cli

The neeo-sdk cli will be removed in a future version. We recommend using the [@neeo/cli](https://github.com/NEEOInc/neeo-sdk-toolkit/tree/master/cli).

To use it for your own driver, either update the NPM script:
```
"scripts": {
  [...]
  "start": neeo-sdk start"
}
```
This allows you to start your driver with `npm start`.

By default, the neeo-sdk cli will connect to the first discovered brain within the network. You can change this behaviour by creating a `"neeoSdkOptions"` property in your project's `package.json`, and set the "brainHost" property to the Brain IP address. Following parameters are available:

```
"neeoSdkOptions": {
  "brainHost": "10.0.0.131", // If configured, connect to this IP. Else connect to the first NEEO Brain discovered
}
```

The Brain lookup uses a default timeout of 5000ms. To change this behaviour, change the environment variable `NEEO_BRAIN_LOOKUP_DURATION_MS`

## SDK Documentation

See https://neeoinc.github.io/neeo-sdk/ for the functions documentation.

### Driver export best practices

The NEEO CLI will look for drivers installed in the node_module folder (installed via npm) which export their devices using the following format:

1. A single file exporting all devices for example `index.js`:
    ```
    module.exports = {
      devices: [
        // Exports listed here will be detected,
        // these are the objects returned by neeo-sdk.buildDevice()
        exampleDriver,
      ],
    };
    ```
2. Your `package.json` main property points to that file:
    ```
      ...
      "main": "index.js",
      ...
    ```
3. In your package.json use the `neeo-driver-` prefix for the name property.*

This allows you to place your export where you please as long as you document it in `package.json`. The CLI will read the `main` property of the package.json for drivers installed via npm.

__This is the recommended setup for exporting devices__:
* one device per driver module**
* Set the path to your main export in your `package.json`: `main: "index.js"`

_* Previously we looked for the `neeo-` and `neeo_` prefixes, these are still detected but we recommend `neeo-driver-`_

_** In some cases like 2 devices of the same model but different series with slightly different features might share common code, they could then be part of the same module._

You can find an example driver: [neeo-driver-example](https://github.com/NEEOInc/neeo-sdk-examples/tree/master/neeo-driver-example) in the neeo-sdk-examples.

See [SDK Driver Migration to 0.51.0](#sdk-driver-migration-to-0510) for migrating to the @neeo/cli

### Running a single driver locally in development mode

When developing a driver it is more convient to directly run a single driver rather than install or link the driver in another folder to use the regular CLI. This also allows attaching a debugger to the process more easiler.

One way to start a driver with the server is to create for example a `devStart.js` file that looks like this:
```
"use strict";

const neeoapi = require("neeo-sdk");
const driver = require("./lib/DeviceController");

// IP of your NEEO Brain
const BRAIN_IP = '10.0.0.10';

neeoapi
  .startServer({
    brain: BRAIN_IP,
    name: 'debug-server',
    devices: [
      driver,
    ]
  })
  .then(() => console.log('Server Ready'))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('ERROR:', error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

You can then start your driver with `node devStart.js` or by adding it to `"start": "node devStart.js"` in your `package.json` scripts `npm start`.

### SDK Driver Migration to 0.50.0

To migrate a driver to the driver device export format, follow:
[Driver migration guide to 0.50.0](./MIGRATION-0-50-0.md). Note: We have updated the example code too, take a look there if something is unclear.

### SDK Driver Migration to 0.51.0

After 0.50.0 we've decided to move the CLI to a separate repository.

To migrate a driver to the new @neeo/cli, follow: [Driver migration guide to @neeo/cli](./MIGRATION-0-51-0.md).

## Hints

A collection of hints if you create a device driver.

* If possible provide a device discovery to find a device to support (`.enableDiscovery`) - this is the most user friendly way for the user to add a device.
* Make sure that your driver handles if the device reboots. It's possible that the device IP changed after the reboot.
* Make sure to handle the case when the user deleted the device from the NEEO Brain, so the driver won't send notifications anymore and shut down any running services (`registerDeviceSubscriptionHandler`).
* Make sure your driver allocate resources only if needed - use the `registerInitialiseFunction` to initialise your driver.
* List the minimal firmware version of the device you use - this might help if a driver does not work as expected.

### Quirks

There are some issues on the SDK we will address in the future. To avoid breaking changes we collect them and bulk fix them in a non breaking way in the future.

* If you added a sensor with the name "MYSENSOR" and want to update a sensor value, you cannot use the name "MYSENSOR" but you need to add the suffix "_SENSOR" (e.g. "MYSENSOR_SENSOR").

# NEEO Macro Names

The view for a device in the recipe is generated automatically depending on the device capabilities.

## Power Control Capability

If your device supports Power control (power on device, power off device), add this capability - the generated recipe
will power on and off your device automatically.

You need to add support for the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `POWER ON`
* `POWER OFF`

or just use the shortcut function `.addButtonGroup('POWER')`


## Volume Control Capability

If your device supports Volume control (volume up and down, optional mute toggle), add this capability - the generated recipe
will automatically use the volume capability of your device.

You need to add support for the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `VOLUME UP`
* `VOLUME DOWN`
* optionally `MUTE TOGGLE`

or just use the shortcut function `.addButtonGroup('VOLUME')`

## Favorites View Capability

If you want support for a custom Favorite view, you need to add support for the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `DIGIT 0`
* `DIGIT 1`
* `DIGIT 2`
* `DIGIT 3`
* `DIGIT 4`
* `DIGIT 5`
* `DIGIT 6`
* `DIGIT 7`
* `DIGIT 8`
* `DIGIT 9`

or just use the helper function `.addButtonGroup('Numpad')`. The device must be one of the following types:

* `TV`
* `DVB` (aka Satellite box, digital receiver)
* `TUNER` (audio tuner)

## Numpad Capability

If you want to add a numpad widget to your view, make sure to implement all the `DIGIT` buttons of the "Favorites View Capability". Supported for `TV`and `DVB` devices.

## Controlpad Capability

To create a Controlpad capability you need to implement the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `CURSOR ENTER`
* `CURSOR UP`
* `CURSOR DOWN`
* `CURSOR LEFT`
* `CURSOR RIGHT`

or just use the helper function `.addButtonGroup('Controlpad')`. The devicetype must be `TV`, `DVB`, `GAMECONSOLE`, `MEDIAPLAYER`, `VOD`, `DVD` or `PROJECTOR`.

## Color Buttons Capability

To create a Controlpad capability you need to implement the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `FUNCTION RED`
* `FUNCTION GREEN`
* `FUNCTION YELLOW`
* `FUNCTION BLUE`

or just use the helper function `.addButtonGroup('Color Buttons')`. The devicetype must be `TV`, `DVB`, `GAMECONSOLE`, `MEDIAPLAYER` or `PROJECTOR`.

## MENU Capability

To create a MENU (navigation) capability you need to implement the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `MENU`
* `BACK`

or just use the helper function `.addButtonGroup('Menu and Back')`. In most cases it make sense to include the Controlpad capability aswell.

## Channel Zapper Capability

To create a Channel Zapper capability (Channel Up/Down) you need to implement the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `CHANNEL UP`
* `CHANNEL DOWN`

or just use the helper function `.addButtonGroup('Channel Zapper')`.

## Transport Capability

If you want to support different transport features (like skip, forward, next) you can include the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `PLAY`, `PAUSE`, `STOP` (helper function: `.addButtonGroup('Transport')`)
* `REVERSE`, `FORWARD` (helper function: `.addButtonGroup('Transport Search')`)
* `PREVIOUS`, `NEXT` (helper function: `.addButtonGroup('Transport Scan')`)
* `SKIP SECONDS BACKWARD`, `SKIP SECONDS FORWARD` (helper function: `.addButtonGroup('Transport Skip')`)

This works for the devices `TV`, `DVB`, `GAMECONSOLE`, `MEDIAPLAYER`, `VOD`, `DVD` or `PROJECTOR`.

## Record Capability

To create a Record capability you need to implement the following buttons (`addButton({..`):
* `MY RECORDINGS`
* `RECORD`
* `LIVE`

or just use the helper function `.addButtonGroup('Record')`. The devicetype must be `TV`, `DVB`. Please note, if you don't have all 3 buttons you can implement only the buttons your device provides.

## Input Capability

If you add support for a devicetype `TV`, `PROJECTOR` or `AVRECIEVER` you should provide discrete input change commands depending of your devices features, for example:
* `INPUT HDMI 1`
* `INPUT HDMI 2`
* `INPUT VGA 1`
* `INPUT SCART 1`
